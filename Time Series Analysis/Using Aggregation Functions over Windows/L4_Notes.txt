As far as performance goes, SQL Server can return results just as quickly with 
4 aggregate window functions as 1 so long as the windows are the same.

RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW - is the default value

The LAG() and LEAD() window functions give us the ability to look backward or forward in time, respectively. 
Note that the LAG() and LEAD() functions only work over the window you specified.
The function call happens after the WHERE clause filters out data.

L1 - DATEPARTS,DATEADD, DATEDIFF, CALENDAR TABLES, (FORMAT,CAST,CONVERT) for reporting
L2 - CAST, CONVERT, PARSE, TRY_CAST, TRY_CONVERT, TRY_PARSE, TIMEZONE, TIMEZONE OFFSET, SWITCHOFFSET
NULL FOR INVALID DATE FORMATS
L3 - COUNT, MIN, MAX, SUM, STATISTICAL, ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING SETS
L4 - WINDOW FUNCTION, RANKING FUNCTION, LAG AND LEAD
